# Static Web Page Generator


The webapp can generated static website using HTML, CSS and JS using user specifications. It uses django with apis from github and openAI in the backend and Next.js in the frontend. The website is capable of handling multiple users and sessions. Each session contain one website.

0) User add their github username, github token and openAI key in the user settings.
1) User creates a new session. 
2) User enters topic and specification of the website.
3) User clicks generate button.
4) The AI will generate an HTML, CSS and JS website.
5) The website is deployed to user's github page.
6) User can modify the website by prompting the AI or by manually editing the code from the website itself.
7) If the user does'nt want to deploy then a preview is shown to the user.


The app is not production ready, might find it hard to run locally aswell. Also there will console.log and localhost here and there. I will fix it in few days.
